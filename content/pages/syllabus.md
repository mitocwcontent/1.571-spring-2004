Course Structure
----------------

This course is composed of two major components.

### Component 1 - Advanced Structural Analysis

This component builds on knowledge obtained in a basic structural analysis course to provide an understanding of analysis and design more complex structures. Topics covered include curved members, analysis and design of cable structures, and non-linear analysis of trusses and members.

### Component 2 - Introduction to Structural Control

This component presents an introduction to the theory of structural control using computer-based methods for the analysis of large-scale structural systems. Focus is on design and implementation of control algorithms for structural systems subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading.
